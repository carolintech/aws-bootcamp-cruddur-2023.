### Install And Verify AWS CLI 
 
I used my local environment on windows because I was unable to use Gitpod or Github codespaces due to browser issues.

I followed the following instructions for the configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install my AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI via command in **Command Prompt**:

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```

I attempted to run the command by typing in 'aws' but got an error which by my closing and reopening the command prompt later worked.
